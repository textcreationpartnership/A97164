            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You know the Scruple-Office, where the doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Siſters are carryed with zeale to joyne in a Reformation with the Reſolving Brethren, and burdened conſciences come to lay downe their loads, and goe away with others; where the Reſolvers take away the doubts, and gain the Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to themſelves: whither ſeeing all flock that know nothing but to doubt, amongſt theſe I preſum'd to make one in the Crowd. Here I found the doubting Brethren turn'd the Reſolvers, and thoſe that held the Chaire, uncertaine in their Reſolutions, and as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113904:3"/>as the Oracles of Old; as thoſe that beleeve not themſelves, what they would have others beleeve. They have proceeded thus farre in the Reformation, and the Reſolutions of Doubts, that they have brought all to that petty Scruple, <hi>Whether Chriſt hath any Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miniſtry, ſince the Apoſtles.</hi> Or, granting a Church to Chriſt, but none to them (<hi>Dato, ſed non Conceſſo; Yerbery</hi> will allow no more.) They diſputed this with them, <hi>Whether they did not more uſurpe on the Title of Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt, then themſelves on the Office, in Preaching?</hi> or (in their owne phraſe) <hi>in hinting truths, holding forth lights, making out Goſpell-Revelations, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their Guifts and Lungs, and in Love edifying the Church</hi> (or if <hi>Yerbery</hi> will better admit the Tearme) <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the faithfull?</hi> Sir, Will you receive the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as I had it in a throng and crowded up, or are you at leiſure to heare at large all Ob's and Sol's?

The Queſtion firſt propos'd, and beat out into 8. or 9. more queſtions or Propoſitions; <hi>Whether the Miniſtery were committed to the hands of ſelected Perſons?</hi> the Theſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; 1. <hi>That Chriſt had a Church.</hi> 2. <hi>That Chriſt had all power and judgment given from God.</hi> 3. <hi>That he was a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King.</hi> 4. <hi>That as a King he Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, Govern'd a Church.</hi> 5. <hi>That in this Church he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome Miniſters,</hi> &amp;c. That was not the Queſtion. And what meant the paper he read in, they knew not, though they knew, and would not diſpute then all the Propoſitions. They came to ſhew their Guifts, not the hands they wrote. They came to have their doubts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, Theſe were truths they ſtood not on. <hi>Yerbery</hi> then roſe up, cry'd downe againe. After an houres de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, what was the queſtion, crying up, decrying, this, that, hinting, holding out, and making forth their minds, they fram'd the Queſtion in tearmes which they impos'd to their owne advantage: <hi>Whether the eſteemed Miniſters of the Church of</hi> England <hi>had more Authority from Jeſus Chriſt to preach in publike, then ordinary Guifted Chriſtians.</hi> Here a double weakeneſſe on the other part, ſtill to inſiſt, and urge their owne Paper, as if they were not they, who have brought in <hi>Extempore</hi> Effuſions throughout the whole ſervice of God, and allow unpremeditated Preaching and praying (ſuch as the Lay might imitate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113904:5"/>and now here challenge) but here allow onely ſet, and premeditated Diſputes. I was again aſham'd to ſee tearms impos'd to their adverſaries advantage, and not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to their doubt, which, while the Scruple-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters urge their owne Propoſitions, is ſtill hinted to be; <hi>Whether it were lawfull for them, who were no Ministers to lay out Scripture in publike, and to undoe Chapters? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were lawfull for the Guifted Chriſtians, or whether it were more lawfull for the eſteemed Miniſters?</hi> The Chaire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man riſeth up, undertakes the Cauſe, but <hi>Mediums</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not readily, againe the Papers call'd in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Why we come hither to have our Doubts reſolv'd, 'tis ſtrange you ſhould tell better then our ſelves, what our doubts are. The Queſtion was hinted on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viz. your biting and unbrotherly railing againſt this way of God, in building up one another. The Chair-man riſeth up againe, and finding it reducible to one of his Propoſitions, offers againe at the Queſtion, and reads his 5. Propoſition with the Proofes; they admitted no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Divines, nor indirect proofes. <hi>Sol.

            <p>How then doe you prove your Calling lawfull. <hi>W. Why is there not a Presbytery now to ordaine Miniſters? Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> your Calling is lawfull that is by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magiſtrate. But who call'd that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, who call'd you? ſo fearefull were they here to defend their owne Calling, leſt they ſhould ſeem to defend their owne Church, or name Biſhops, that to wave the Anſwer <hi>R.</hi> ſtands up, and informes them what was a lawfull Calling. <hi>To a lawfull calling is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in the perſons call d the qualifications mentioned, Piety and Parts; in the calling the Inward and Outward Call: the Outward calling double: in a ſetled Church to be by the Miniſters, the Presbytery, in an unſetled Church, as in times of Reformation, the extraordinary or (more properly) the univerſall way is by the whole Church,

            <p>Col. this then (if I miſtake not) is the ſubſtance of your Speech, that the perſons call'd are to be qualifi'd with ſanctity and knowledge.
